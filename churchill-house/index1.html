        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Churchill House, at
        <address>216 Northbourne Avenue</address> in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill
        Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major
        commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd
        and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70 and
        construction was completed in 1971. The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style
        (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.

        The complex comprises a number of components: the main building with its east and south wings, the separate
        north wing or pavilion, the pool and the rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape in plan, and with the
        north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool is located. The main building is of three
        storeys with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner, the north wing is of two storeys, and the carpark
        is two storeyed.
